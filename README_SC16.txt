An Exploration of Optimization Algorithms for High Performance Tensor Completion
Shaden Smith, Jongsoo Park, and George Karypis
Supercomputing 2016

This repository contains the source code used for experiments involving the
ALS and CCD++ algorithms, and also the shared-memory SGD algorithm. Source
code for distributed-memory SGD can be found in the 'sc16-sgd' branch and
will be merged soon.

Follow compilation instructions in 'README.md'. All tensor completion
algorithms can be accessed via:

$ ./build/Linux-x86_64/bin/splatt complete

Add a '--help' flag for usage instructions.
